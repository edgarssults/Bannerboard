# Description

This is a mod for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord that lets you view game data in real time on a dashboard in a browser.

When the mod is loaded it sets up a local WebSocket server and pushes updates to connected clients.
The client is a Blazor WebAssembly app that runs in a browser and connects to the local WebSocket server and listens for updates.

No data is sent outside your system, the browser downloads the client code and runs it locally.

# Widgets

## Lords
